# URLIX - Free Unlimited URL Shortener

URLIX is a free, unlimited URL shortener service built with an easy-to-use API. It allows you to quickly convert long URLs into compact, shareable links while tracking redirection statisticsâ€”all in one place. As a student, I developed this project to learn and explore web development concepts.

## Features

- **URL Shortening:** Easily convert lengthy web addresses into short, manageable URLs.
- **Customizable Slugs:** Personalize the end part of your short URL to make it memorable.
- **Security Options:** Protect your links with password protection and set expiration dates for added control.
- **QR Code Generation:** Automatically generate QR codes for each URL to facilitate quick sharing.
- **Redirection Statistics:** Monitor the performance of your short URLs with detailed statistics directly from your dashboard.
- **Advanced Management:** Use filtering tools to search and manage your links efficiently.
- **API Access:** Obtain an API key to integrate URLIX into your own applications without any usage limits.

**How It Works:**

1. **Sign Up:** Create an account using a valid email address and complete the verification process.
2. **Create & Manage:** Once logged in, you can create new short URLs, customize them, and assign internal names for easier management.
3. **Update & Secure:** Update account details, change your email or password, and manage your URLs from an intuitive interface.
